# APIconnect: A CRUD API Development Project with FastAPI and PostgreSQL

APIconnect is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API project built using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). It allows you to manage resources through HTTP requests.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete resources (e.g., users, products, posts).
- Authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Error handling and validation.
- PostgreSQL as the database backend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (v3.7 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (local or cloud-based)

## Getting Started

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/APIconnect.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd APIconnect
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
